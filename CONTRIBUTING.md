# Contributing a PR 🥇 

Hello 👋 ! Thank you for your interest in contributing to a project!

Here is a typical workflow for contributing... if you have *any* questions, please ask!

0. Decide what you want to work on (if you want to fix an issue, please comment on the issue asking us to assign it to you)
1. [Fork][fork] the repository you want to work on
2. [Clone][clone] the forked repository locally
3. [Create a branch][branch]
    - We recommend starting your branch name with the issue number you are working on
    - We also recommend giving your branch a helpful name
    - A good branch name is `7-fix-lint-errors`; a bad one is `fix-stuff`
4. Make your code changes
    - This is the really fun part 😃
5. Write tests
    - Another fun part as you get to write some tests to show off your work 🚀
6. Push your changes to your fork
7. [Create a pull request][pr] from your fork to the original repository
8. We'll review the updates you made and merge the PR!
